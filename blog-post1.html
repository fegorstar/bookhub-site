                    <p>The <a href="https://futminna.edu.ng/home/" target="_blank">Federal University of Technology, Minna (FUTMinna)</a> spearheads a transformative initiative to revolutionise academic book publishing in Nigeria. Rooted in the vision of democratising access to knowledge and fostering sustainable publishing ecosystems, this movement began at the workshop for the <a href="https://libsense.ren.africa/en/event/libsense-open-access-book-project/" target="_blank">LIBSENSE in Nigeria Book Project</a>, which catalysed discussions on leveraging Open Access (OA) and digital tools to modernise academic book publishing.</p>
                    <p>Through strategic partnerships with Datasphir and <a href="https://openbookcollective.pubpub.org/pub/annoucing-obcs-first-collective-development-fund-award-fostering-academic-self-reliance-in-nigeria-through-open-access-books" target="_blank">funding support from the Open Book Collective (OBC)</a>, FUTMinna is turning these discussions into action, setting a precedent for innovation in Nigerian academia and beyond.</p>

                    <h2>The Eko-Konnect Spark: Where Innovation Took Root</h2>
                    <p>The LIBSENSE workshop at the <a href="https://2024.eko-konnect.org.ng/" target="_blank">Eko-Konnect User Conference 2024</a> brought together stakeholders from Nigeria’s academic and research communities to address the challenges of traditional scholarly publishing. During this workshop, participants articulated a bold vision: to modernise book publishing systems and make high-quality academic materials freely available through Open Access platforms.</p>
                    <p>Following the conference, Datasphir played a critical role in refining this vision, providing technical expertise to develop <a href="http://datasphir.com/bookhub" target="_blank">BookHub</a>, a cutting-edge OA publishing solution tailored to the needs of Nigerian institutions based on Open Source software from <a href="https://ketty.community/" target="_blank">Coko</a>. With FUTMinna as the pioneering pilot site, the project is evolving a roadmap for transforming academic publishing.</p>

                    <h2>FUTMinna and BookHub: Pioneering the Future of Book Publishing</h2>
                    <p>At the heart of this transformation is BookHub, which FUTMinna is piloting to modernise its Academic Publishing Centre (APC). Key achievements and objectives include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Transforming the Academic Publishing Landscape:</strong> 
                            By Q1 2025, FUTMinna will have successfully piloted the publication of 8 locally authored OA books, and at least 18 more by the end of the year, making critical academic resources freely accessible online.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Fostering Collaboration and Community:</strong>
                            Regional writing workshops and book sprints will engage authors, editors, and librarians, fostering a culture of collaboration and expertise.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Advancing Policy and Advocacy:</strong>
                            FUTMinna is working closely with national stakeholders, including the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), to align academic publishing practices with Open Access principles.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Modernising Book Publishing Practices:</strong>
